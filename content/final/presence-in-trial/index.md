Or the act of being "there", being present in trial.

My father passed away a couple weeks ago. It's an incredible loss. One day you have a dad. Another you don't (I'll write more about this in a later post). Because his death was not a shock, as battles with cancer are typically no overnight thing, I had the chance to spend several months by his side. Along with some other family, it took us to Houston, Reno, Salt Lake, and our hometown in Montana. For four of those weeks, it was just my dad and me.

Those are times I will always cherish. It was the act of being there. Experiencing the pain he was in. Listening to the difficult doctor visits. Making his food. Feeding him through the feeding tube. Waking up in the morning to check on him and seeing the pile of papertowels from all the coughing.

Sad memories but good memories. It meant a lot to him as well. I imagine the tangible feeling of being loved and cared for in times of trial was critical to his soul in the last days. I'm incredibly thankful I was able to spend as much time with him as I did.

It was interesting to see how friends and family interacted during this time. I recognize that personalities play a big part in times like this. Some show love through engagement, others really care but simply can't handle the day-to-day. It struck me, however, that some were present and others weren't. Some of his closest friends were not engaged. They would call occasionally, possibly came out once to see him but that's it. They weren't truly present. They weren't there when he needed them most. Others, who met my dad only recently, were there. They came to see him, encourage him, show love. They prayed with him and for him. They asked what they could do. They were **present in trial**.

I'm struck by the power of presence. And the great power of being "there" throughout seasons of life. It's a lot of work. It requires self-sacrifice. I hope I can grow to be the sort of friend that lays aside what's going on in my life to be present with those around me.

Mike Mueller is one of those friends for me. He was present with me the week of the funeral. A public thanks to you, my friend.
