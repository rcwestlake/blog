Is it possible to be a millionaire and poor? Yes. Apparently.

I recently read an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/technology/05rich.html) in the New York Times. I didn't realize until after I finished that it was written in 2007. Funny thing is that it feels like it was written yesterday. In summary, there are people who are millionaires (those who have a net worth in excess of $1,000,000) who consider themselves poor. Typically, when you are in the top few percent of a group, you feel good about being in that company. However, on the off chance you are radically successful (compared to the rest of the world) in Silcone Valley, you are left feeling radically inadequate.

What struck me was not that their opinion of themselves was low, but the fact that they felt unsatisfied. To a degree, I shouldn't be surprised. Time and time again, history has proven that "stuff" doesn't greatly enhance your life. What's interesting though, is that it almost seems that they are ashamed of the minor millionaire status. If they were a major millionaire they probably wouldn't still be working like their lives depended on it (to use a phrase for emphasis).

I wonder though: deep down is it only an act or do they really feel like their lives depend on it?

## Golden Handcuffs

With a semi wild imagination, if Vincent van Gogh was living today, and he read that article, I like to think he would paint a vivid piece of art. Stark even. It would have a big city backdrop. Beautiful buildings. Inside those buildings, lots of people working at standup desks. The key to the painting, although a subtle addition, are the people walking along the streets, face down, with golden handcuffs. They are walking with determination. Cuffed. With the key in their back pocket.

Maybe that picture doesn't do it for you. If not, I hope the principle does.

Why are they still living there? Why not move somewhere else where the cost of living is significantly less, where the immense pressure to succeed simply for the sake of success is less? Why do we have to grind until we've "made" it in the land of tech money? What's the answer?

The heart is a fickle thing, and I don't even begin to communicate that I understand it. In fact, I'm not so sure I wouldn't get caught up in the mess myself if that was the bowl I was swimming in.

If that was me, I hope someone would be kind enough to at least tell me that *the key is in my back pocket.*
