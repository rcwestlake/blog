Slack is a huge part of my life. I use it in my daily job and send thousands of messages each year. I've been tracking their progress through investor updates. And when they recently went to the public markets, I invested a little money.

The story of Slack's birth and rebirth is pretty interesting (listen [here](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/633164558/slack-flickr-stewart-butterfield)).

At it's core, it's a communication app. It replaces email in 90% of cases for companies. The remaining 10% is external relationships (think customer service and sales) and still requires email.

The (simple) math is impressive. If you multiply all the companies with employees that don't use Slack, by the price-per-month, it's a large number. They've already proven they can convince those types of companies.

The (complex) math is a bit more interesting. If companies stick with email, it's probably in the $5 range per employee ($5 for Google's Gsuite which includes Gmail). I think we're past that though. Employees won't stand for that - they need something in additional to email. So now companies have to pay for both, which is a significant cost for an enterprise over even 20 people.

## Why It's Compelling

1. Atlassian. A similar company in the productivity, business-tool space. Their stock has grown leaps and bounds in the past year (in the ballpark of 100%). They are a niche company which has expanded into less niche areas. From tools for developers to company documentation. Slack could follow a similar path.
2. Huge growth. I mean - they've exploded. That is never a negative sign.
3. Employees :imagine-heart-emoji: Slack. Unlike a lot of business software, Slack has staying power. People really, really like it. Email has the staying power akin to rain in the rainforest. Slack could develop the same kind of presence.
4. Remote communication will only grow. People will more and more work outside the office. Email doesn't work for that. Companies have to provide an alternative, and Slack is clearly the best one and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

## Why It's Concerning

1. They're not profitable. This will always be near the top for me if it's true. No profits typically point to a leak somewhere in the boat.
2. It was hyped. Long-term the [market is a weighing machine](https://news.morningstar.com/classroom2/course.asp?docId=142901&page=7), hype is short-lived.
3. A narrow product focus. I love when someone or something is the BEST at a thing. Slack is the best at large scale inter-business communication. But that market has a limit, and like many things, is not a 100 year game plan. In 5 years I could see Slack doing the same thing. In 10 years, maybe. In 20, I just don't buy it. They need to be more. A different communication or tool will come along, possibly built by Slack itself, but casting all your bread upon the waters in a single boat is a risky endeavor.
4. Microsoft. They already have an "in" with the Office 365 product suite. I predict Microsoft will chip away on larger, more corporate companies who can simply integrate with their existing Microsoft products but struggle to catch most of the up-and-coming companies. It will be a fight.
5. Overuse. And that leads to fatigue. And that leads to burnout. Could companies get tired of Slack? Possibly. Right now they're stuck, the alternatives just aren't there.

## Value and Growth Opportunity

When they first announced their foray into the public markets, I thought: they have the makings of something big. Their recurring revenue is amazing. It's a thing of business dreams. But consistent, recurring growth will make Warren Buffet happy, not necessarily the rest of the investor universe. Slack will need to continue to show substance. To me, that substance will come in two ways:

1. Grow with companies. As customers grow, Slack grows.
2. Expand beyond communication. Become more than a communication tool.

The way I see it: they could become the go to source for all things needed to run a company. Communication, HR, benefits.

**Build Strategy**

They can build a way to completely replace email. Low hanging fruit? Possibly. Like Atlassian, they can build more products that fit within a product suite.

**Buy Strategy**

Buy a company like Gusto to fill the HR and Benefits hole. People love and trust Slack. Use that trust to make further inroads. This would be the faster path.

The 10 Cents

It's a ~10 year play.

They won't be profitable for 7 years.

That will hurt their stock.

They need to expand beyond workplace communication.

Building or buying to get there will cost, further hindering cash flow for the estimated 7 years I mentioned above.
