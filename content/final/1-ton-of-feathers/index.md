> If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way. -- Napolean Hill

*Principle*: a one-ton box of feathers weighs the same as a one-ton elephant.

*Summarized Principle*: many small things can weigh the same as one big thing. We can't as a single human being lift an elephant with our bare hands. However, 2,000 people can each lift a pound of feathers and it's the same.

*Thought of the Day*: I would love to create a foundation that helps people, especially young people, volunteer in small ways that equate to large impact. 2,000 people volunteering 10 times a year is 10,000 days or 27 years of volunteer work. That is game-changing impact. Just gets me excited thinking about it.
